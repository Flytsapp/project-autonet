Project Autonet
.

****Project Autonet??? is a project started for ****codevour??? and is based on the idea that mordern traffic system can be safer if we store data of every data important for traffic regulation in a database and all the cars on the road will use that data for safer driving. For example, A human driving a car will not be able to exceed speed-limit if his car knows the speed-limit and it will not exceed that. It will also not cross any traffic signal. The mordern concept of ***Autonomous vehicles??? and ***robotaxis??? will also be more safe to build. The jproject also focuses on some other topics related to traffic security.
