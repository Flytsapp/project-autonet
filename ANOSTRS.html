The table shown above is ****`locations`??? table in Autonet Database. The two coloums highlited are ****`trafficsignal`??? and ****`speedlimit`???. Basically, the data of traffic regulation is in location details. Every location has an traffic signal and speed-limit.
.
hc
trafficsignal
.
txt
It is a binary data. It is 0 for green signal and is 1 for red signal at the location.
.
hc
speedlimit
.

.
txt
The request takes location of which we want to get details as a URL parameter ****`loc`???. In return it gives the following pattern.
.
codetxt
`name`~`trafficsignal`~`speedlimit`~`leadsto`
.
txt
Here all ****`name`???,****`trafficsignal`???,****`speedlimit`??? and ****`leadsto`??? are Autonet Database coloums of ****`locations`??? table and the returned text will contain data in the above stated coloums of the row with the `loc` stated in request.

Lets look at The ANOSTRS Data in Autonet Database again.
.

.
txt
Lets take an example request
.
codeurl
"http://{ip}/autonet/api/getlocationinfo.php?loc=01"
.
txt
Here, the response will be
.
codetxt
Hospital~0~100~02 r14
.
txt
Name of location - Hospital
.
txt
Traffic signal there - 0 (Green)
.
txt
Speed Limit there - 100%
.
txt
It leads to locations - 02 and 14 after right turn
.
txt
In this way, we get the information about trafficsignal and speed limit of particular location.
.
hc
setsignal
.
codeurl
"http://{ip}/autonet/api/setsignal.php?loc={location}&signal={desired_signal}"
.
txt
The request takes location of which we want to set traffic signal as a URL parameter ****`loc`??? and the signal as a URL parameter ****`signal`??? which is a binary value, ****0??? for Green and ****1??? for Red. The response in return will be ***200??? in case of success and will be ***0??? in case of failure.

Whenever receives a signal that it has reached a location, it fetches the speed limit and traffic signal information from the server with the above stated request,
.
codeurl
"http://{ip}/autonet/api/getlocationinfo.php?loc={location}"
.
txt
then send the speed-limit of the location received from server to the quarky.
.
txt
If the traffic light is red, then ESP sends zero speed to quarky. It then continuously starts fetching location information till traffic light at that location is green. If the light gets green then ESP sends speed equal to speed-limit to quarky.
